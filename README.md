## Javalin Forms
---
### Description

In this lab we will cover how add forms to your web application using Javalin and JTE.

---
### Steps

1. In src -> main -> java -> objects -> SeaCreatures.java add a field for an arraylist of sea creature names similar to the one in ShoppingList.java. Add the required imports for this step.
2. Add public methods for adding to this list and getting the list.
3. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java add the required fields, methods and handlers for the SeaCreatures to be sent to form.jte. For reference see the fields, methods and handlers for ShoppingList in Main.java. Your code should be written underneath the To-Do comments.
4. In src -> main -> java -> jte -> form.jte modify the file to add SeaCreature names instead of ShoppingList items.
5. In src -> main -> java -> jte -> index.jte modify the file to list out SeaCreature names instead of ShoppingList items.

### Sample Output

"Welcome"

```
